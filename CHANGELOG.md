### Removed
* Remove AWS autoscaling in favor of buildkite-agent-scaler [#575](https://github.com/buildkite/elastic-ci-stack-for-aws/pull/575) ([lox](https://github.com/lox)) [#588](https://github.com/buildkite/elastic-ci-stack-for-aws/pull/588) ([jeremiahsnapp](https://github.com/jeremiahsnapp))
* Multiple parameters! See below

### Summary of parameter changes:
The following parameters have been **removed** or **reworked**:
* `EnableExperimentalLambdaBasedAutoscaling` was removed (it's the default now)
* `BuildkiteOrgSlug` was removed – the statistics reported by [buildkite-agent-scaler](https://github.com/buildkite/buildkite-agent-scaler/blob/0a127ce221c94ffa703882b233a630ccde67d824/README.md#publishing-cloudwatch-metrics) make it redundant, but consider [buildkite-agent-metrics](https://github.com/buildkite/buildkite-agent-metrics) if you need more detailed metric monitoring
* `BuildkiteTerminateInstanceAfterJobTimeout` is replaced by the more concise `ScaleInIdlePeriod` [#586](https://github.com/buildkite/elastic-ci-stack-for-aws/pull/586) ([jeremiahsnapp](https://github.com/jeremiahsnapp))
* `BuildkiteTerminateInstanceAfterJobDecreaseDesiredCapacity` and `ScaleDownAdjustment` were  removed - instances will now always try to decrement the ASG desired count when their waiting period for new jobs has elapsed
* `ScaleUpAdjustment` is replaced by `ScaleOutFactor` as the new lambda scaler calculates how many agents are needed at the time
* `ScaleDownPeriod` and `ScaleCooldownPeriod` are replaced by `ScaleInIdlePeriod`

The following other parameters have been **added**:
* `ScaleOutFactor` (default: `1.0`) is a multiplier that allows you to add extra agents when scaling up is needed
* `ScaleInIdlePeriod` (default: `600` seconds) is used for scale-in by letting idle agents remove themselves from the ASG
* `InstanceOperatingSystem` (default: `linux`) can be used to specify Windows if you need Windows Server 2019 instances
* *Windows-only* `BuildkiteWindowsAdministrator` (default: `true`) adds the local "buildkite-agent" user account to the local Windows Administrator group
* *optional* `BuildkiteAgentTokenParameterStorePath` and `BuildkiteAgentTokenParameterStoreKMSKey` are for storing your token in [SSM Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) and are an alternative to `BuildkiteAgentToken`
* *optional* `ScaleOutForWaitingJobs` (default: `false`) can help anticipate future job load and get your instances ready ahead of time
